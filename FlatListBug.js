This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and trying to render a large number of items.  The performance can degrade significantly, and you might not see any errors in the console, but the UI will be unresponsive or freeze. This is particularly challenging to debug because it doesn't always produce a clear error message. The root cause is often related to inefficient rendering or data handling within the FlatList.
